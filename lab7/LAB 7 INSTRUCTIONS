dynamically insert nodes into the DOM
<p> w/ classes for CSS and text
<span>
<ul>

~~~


Step 1: 
make a text box
add button
make two arrows  (famfamfam.com)
click actions for right and left

~~~

Step 2: 
type in some colors and  make boxes of colors based on the string of text inside
add colors = 

append colors
loop through array

css class of color
target them based on THIS
get color 
$(this).css('background-color') --> tells you thr background color (doesn't set it)

s = "blue, green, yellow"

s.split(', ') // makes string into array 
comma space is delimeter

loop through array.length

DONE
~~


Hover event handler for color boxes
background color of text input area changes based on selected box(this.css(backround-color))


~~

Step 3:
Click box to select and get black border
click box to remove border

if selected - null


~~~

Double click removes the box 
remove.
$(this).remove();

~~~

Step4 -- MOVING elements back and forth (one lime of code)
var s = (this).prev
this.before()

s.prev
s.next
before/after 

Hard part is selection of boxes

global variable for "selected"
var = selected initally is null
var = selected == this
(check by asking "does this == selected")

Adrian mentioned global "boolean" variable
